## 📌 Overview
In high-traffic environments like universities or public hubs, managing equipment loans can be chaotic. **ChargeNow** simplifies this by offering a centralized CLI (Command Line Interface) dashboard.

The application serves two distinct user groups:
1.  **Users (Borrowers):** Can quickly rent devices using their institutional ID.
2.  **Admins:** Have full control over inventory, return processing, penalty calculation, and audit logs.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👤 User Module
* **Fast Borrowing Workflow:** Streamlined input for Name, Student ID (NIM), and Study Program.
* **Real-time Availability:** View currently available units (e.g., PB001 - PB005) instantly.
* **Auto-Timestamp:** Rental start time is automatically captured upon confirmation.

### 🛡️ Admin Module
* **Active Rental Dashboard:** Monitor who is currently holding a device and for how long.
* **Smart Return System:**
    * Calculates duration automatically.
    * **Late Detection logic:** Automatically flags returns that exceed the time limit.
    * **Penalty Enforcement:** Triggers a penalty form if the device is returned late.
* **Comprehensive History:** A persistent (session-based) log of all transactions for auditing purposes.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

This project is crafted to showcase fundamental software engineering concepts:

| Concept | Implementation in ChargeNow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OOP Principles** | Utilizes Classes and Objects to model `User`, `PowerBank`, and `Transaction`. |
| **Data Structures** | Implements `ArrayList` for dynamic storage of history and active rentals. |
| **Logic & Control** | Complex `if-else` and `switch-case` structures for menu navigation and penalty logic. |
| **Input Handling** | Robust `Scanner` implementation to handle various data types (String, Integer). |
| **Encapsulation** | Private fields with public getters/setters to ensure data integrity. |
